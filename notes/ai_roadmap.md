description: A roadmap for getting started and some links

Where to begin
=============

> Algorithms: Lin Reg -\> Log Reg -\> NN -\> CNN + RNN -\> GANs +
> Transformers -\> ViT -\> Multimodal AI + LLMs + Diffusion + Auto
> Encoders SVM, PCA, kNN, k-means clustering, etc.
>
> LightGBM, XGboost, Catboost, etc.
>
> Optimization and optimizers.
>
> Application-wise: Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Pose
> Estimation, Text Generation, Summarization, NER, Image Generation,
> Captioning, Sequence Generation (like music/speech), text to speech,
> speech to text, recommender systems, sentiment amalysis, tabular data,
> etc. - [Source]
