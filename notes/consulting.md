[Thanks for the feedback]
=========================

- positive feedback makes people uncomfortable
- negative feedback makes people defensive

> That’s because receiving feedback sits at the junction of two
> conflicting human desires. We do want to learn and grow. And we also
> want to be accepted just as we are right now.

Don't forget: most of the time we are operating with incomplete informations.
