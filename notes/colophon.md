Colophon
========

> In publishing, a colophon is a brief statement containing information

This website
------------

-   has no js
-   uses handwritten css
-   the home page is under 250kb
-   has no form of hotlinking - no external css,js,font

How it works
------------

Tools I use for translating my markdown notes to static html:

-   gnu make - 200 LoC
-   lowdown - markdown translator
-   [tidy] - correct, cleanup and format html files
-   rsync - upload to the webserver
-   some unix commands to process metadata (grep, tr, sort, printf)

First I translate the markdown fragments with lowdown, then I put the
page together with inlined html fragments (navigation menu, footer, html
header etc.) With make, I can list multiple markdown parts as
prequisites that should be put on the the same html page.

    docs/%.html: docs/%.pre
    	$(call html_envelope, $*.md, $^ )

    docs/notes.html: docs/notes.pre docs/tags.pre docs/recent.pre

My metadata
-----------

As described in the [lowdown manual], the syntax follows the MMD
speficiation.

TODO
----

-   automated check for dead links
-   generate RSS feed for my notebook
-   lowdown is a lovely piece of software, but maybe markdown is not for
    me
