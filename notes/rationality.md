Falsification
-------------

[Falsification ratio]

Time you spend with falsifying ideas:

> The lesson I found the most striking is this: there’s a direct
> correlation between how skilled you are as a chess player, and how
> much time you spend falsifying your ideas. The authors find that
> grandmasters spend longer falsifying their idea for a move than they
> do coming up with the move in the first place, whereas amateur players
> tend to identify a solution and then play it shortly after without
> trying their hardest to falsify it first.

Pure science
------------

[FAM: Az objektív igazság határa és az akarat bölcselete]

The moment you start using human language, words and phrases you exit
the realm of pure science.
