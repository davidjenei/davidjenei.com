Activities worth dedicating time in the age of artifical intelligence
=====================================================================

Things worth spending time with:

-   requirement engineering: identifying scope and system boundaries
-   evaluating text meaningfulness, identifying AI generated content
-   veryfing requirements: reading code, understanding abstractions, testing implementation
-   team work: improving development methodologies
-   strategic planning: making decisions, selecting the right tools
-   tooling: knowing how to utilise tools, eg. how to apply AI
-   ethics
-   functional safety

Things AI can do or will do soon:

-   writing tutorials and getting-started guides
-   performing basic data exploration
-   detecting anomalies
-   creating filler text
-   dealing with legal text: summarizing, writing

Where to begin
--------------

> Algorithms: Lin Reg -\> Log Reg -\> NN -\> CNN + RNN -\> GANs +
> Transformers -\> ViT -\> Multimodal AI + LLMs + Diffusion + Auto
> Encoders SVM, PCA, kNN, k-means clustering, etc.
>
> LightGBM, XGboost, Catboost, etc.
>
> Optimization and optimizers.
>
> Application-wise: Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Pose
> Estimation, Text Generation, Summarization, NER, Image Generation,
> Captioning, Sequence Generation (like music/speech), text to speech,
> speech to text, recommender systems, sentiment amalysis, tabular data,
> etc. - [Source]
