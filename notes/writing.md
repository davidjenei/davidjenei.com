Short sentences work
--------------------

> This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word
> sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to
> what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it
> drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now
> listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The
> writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use
> short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes,
> when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a
> sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and
> builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the
> crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
