About #cpp
==========

What is C++?

Zero cost abstraction.

With other words, follows [Zero-overhead principle].

This requires a ton of features.

18 different [forms] of [initialisation].

And a 260 page [book] just to explain move semantic.

Needs proper tooling from day 1: clang-tidy, cppcheck, ASAN etc.

And the complete understanding of the [guideline].

Because the language won't save you from [this].

And nothing will stop you from incorrectly assigning smart pointers.

Just as with raw pointers.

So you should write good code, don't make mistakes.

This is a high risk, high reward game.

And when you make one, it has nothing to do with the language.

It's because [you are holding it wrong].

But what about your team members?
