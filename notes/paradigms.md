Algorithmic paradigms and design patterns
=========================================

Divide and conquer
------------------

-   Decompose and combine
-   Divide - conquer - combine
-   eg. Merge sort

Dynamic programming
-------------------

-   Name?? - Decompose and overlap
-   Can be seen as a special D&C where caching is applied.
-   Gives an optimised solution - reuse previous solutions.
-   eg. Knapsack, Fibonacci

Greedy
------

-   never reconsiders
-   reduce problem into a small one with each step
-   eg. Coin problem, Kruskal's algorithm

Backtracking
------------

-   eg. Eight queens
