My C++ Makefile project
-----------------------

TODO: publish it!

TODO: Highlight some interesting parts

Usecase
-------

80% declarative 20% procedural

**Task automation**

Use make to give your projects a [unified interface]

**Build system**

Response to Make critics
------------------------

**Make commands aren't documented**

> When using Make, the Makefile and other source code is all the

Definitely not self-documenting, but we can have something like this:

    help:
        @echo "usage: make [OPTIONS] <target>"
        @echo "  Options:"
        @echo "    > VERBOSE Show verbose output for Make rules. Default 1. Disable with 0."
        @echo "    > SANITIZER Compile with GCC sanitizer. Default none. Options: address, thread, etc."
        @echo "Targets:"
        @echo "  debug: Builds all with debug flags"
        @echo "  release: Build with optimiser"
        @echo "  test: Build test executable"

What is the alternative here? How does a tool like `invoke` solves this?
pip install requests?

To check if an executable is installed we can use something like this:

    CPPCHECK = cppcheck

    define check_exec
        @command -v $(1) >/dev/null || (echo ERROR: $(1) not found in path >&2; exit 1)
    endef

    cppcheck:
        $(call check_exec, $(CPPCHECK))
        $(CPPCHECK) $(CPPCHECKFLAGS) $(SRC) $(SRC_TESTS) $(INCLUDE)

(??? or use `$(error textâ€¦)`)

**Make does not support cross platform builds**

Ouch. This hits hard.

**Make is hard to debug**

With this:

    print-%:
        @echo $* = $($*)

We can at least print the variables:

    djen at xps in ~/example-cpp-project
    make print-CXXFLAGS
    CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -I/usr/include/png++
    djen at xps in ~/example-cpp-project
    make SANITIZER=thread print-CXXFLAGS
    CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -I/usr/include/png++ -fsanitize=thread

**Scaling**

> In Memfaultâ€™s codebase, we have around 100 tasks, most of which are
> namespaced under general top-level modules.

We can organise code in separate files `MyModule.include` and have them
included.

Alternatives
------------

**As a task runner or project CLI**

[Invoke] with [examples]

**As a build system for cross platform targets**

CMake, Meson

CMake
-----

Is CMake really the "cpp standard"? Check out the [Rise of Meson].
