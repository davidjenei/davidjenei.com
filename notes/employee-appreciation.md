Pay fair
--------

At the end of the day, being an employee means trading time and effort
for money. Definitely the easiest way to express appreciation is to pay.
People don't like to hear that, so it needs to be repeated.

If you can't pay fair (as a manager with fix budget), at least donâ€™t
make people feel like theyâ€™re suckers for sticking around.

Listen to them
--------------

Don't dismiss all suggestions immediately.

**Be approachable**

Create an environment where the staff does not feel anxious about asking
questions or bringing up concerns.

**Be open to new ideas**

As a manager, you need to keep an open mind so you will notice when an
operation can be improved.

Build trust
-----------

Trust is a major element in a healthy work environment.

**Have strong analytical abilities**

Strong cognitive skills and analytic approach is vital leadership
traits, no questions here.

**Make decisions. And make them with confidence**

Act decisively, good leaders quickly arrive at their decisions and
effectively communicating their goals. When a decision is made, a
managers must have confidence in their problem-solving skills

**Be honest**

The best leaders were described as providing honest, and at times even
sometimes blunt, feedback. Subordinates felt they could always count on
straight answers from their leader.

**Set an example**

You set an example and express the diligence, enthusiasm and other
skills that you expect from the people whom you manage.

**Recognize good work**

Give credit where credit is due.

**Beat them on their own game**

This is essential for technical roles but comes handy in other positions
too. You should provide technical expertise to lead any team and have
them confidence in you.

Make it personal
----------------

This sounds cheesy, but everyone needs social interactions to some degree.

With other humans, not machines.
