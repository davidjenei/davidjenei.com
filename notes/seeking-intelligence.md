[Notes on Noam Chomsky: The False Promise of ChatGPT][1]
========================================================

Causality
----

AI can describe and predict the most probable outcome, but lacks causal
explanation.

And in most cases, the answer is highly improbable.

We often mistake correlation for causality. In this regard ChatGPT is
like us.

But since Chat GPT does not understand causality, it doesn't know what
is impossible. Notice that Chat GPT rarely says that you're wrong.

Moral
-----

According to Chomsky, intelligence also includes moral.

But in case of Chat GPT it's an afterthought. Our mind is not a
probabilistic engine with an output that is later regulated based on a
certain set of rules. It's rather the opposite, we generate output based
on these inherent rules.
