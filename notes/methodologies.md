Development methodologies
=========================

Collecting terms software engineers use everyday, but often with
different meanings.

Agile, scrum, extreme programming
---------------------------------

Agile is an **iterative** way of managing projects based on a set of
**principles**.

> Iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a
> sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single
> iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting
> point of the next iteration. - [Wikipedia]

We can repeat the same process in every iteration:

-   define tasks
-   estimate
-   identify goal
-   execute
-   release
-   review

Or alternate between different processes:

-   exploring and refining requirements
-   extending and reducing complexity
-   prototyping and validating
-   implementing and testing

> Agile is a set of principles, scrum is a framework.

What are these principles? - See [Agile manifesto]

What is this **framework** about?

-   defines 3 roles: PO, SM, developer (note that the architect is not
    one)
-   organises iterations

Scrum criticism: very well defined (opposing the principle of
interactions over tools)

Extreme programming is another framework?

> take best practices to an extreme level.

Theme, epic, story, task
------------------------

We organise work items into groups and hierarchies. But what is the
baseline in this structure?

**User story**

-   written in simple language, from the perspective of the end user
-   focuses on the end goal, team details requirements later
-   written by product owner, later discussed by the team on planning

**Epic**

-   TODO: what is an epic?

**Milestone?**

Boards
------

We can use boards to **visualize** work and **limit** items. The end
goal is to see who works on what.

**Kanban**

-   tickets
-   columns
-   limits

**Scrum**

-   track iteration
