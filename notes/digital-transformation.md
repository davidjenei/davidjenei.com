Digital transformation
======================

Pillars of digital transformation
---------------------------------

What is the incentive?

- Empower employees - intelligent workspace
- Engage customers - individual customer experiences
- Optimize operations - reduce cost, improve service level
- Transform products - use data ez strategic asset

IoT is a network of Internet connected devices that communicate sensor
data to the cloud for centralized processing.

Pillars of IoT architecture
---------------------------

- Things: Physical "things," with embedded sensors (with *some*
  computational power) sending telemetry data.
- Insights: The results from processing and analyzing the data.
- Actions: The automated, or manual, response to the insights.

Once data is collected analyze and gain meaningful, actionable insights.

Insight are uncovered from telemetry data.

What is the notion of edge computing?
-------------------------------------

Intelligent edge is the continually-expanding set of connected systems
and devices that gather and analyze information close to the physical
world where data resides.

Moving compute workloads to edge devices.

Benefits:

- latency: react to local changes, avoid network latency
- availability: operate in offline or intermittent mode, increased
  reliability
- cost: distribute workload, filter data - reduce computation,
  transportation and storage costs
- privacy: cleanse person related data

Business challenges:

- Complexity
- Cost
- Security

Marketing side: what you can sell on the market

Engineering side: what you can actually do for you today

What we are witnessing today?

Hardware is getting more sophisticated at low price points... Sense of
security...

Engineering goal: Connect cloud solutions to the edge, enable secure and
reliable communication from hardware to cloud all the way up

Technical challenges:

- track and maintaing data coming from all devices
- secure communication
- scale
- manage lifecycle

keyword: deploy, manage, and scale

70% of IoT projects don't get past of the prototype phase

- cutting corners on security
- team not being on the same page: manufacturing partner in China,
  separate teams developing embedded firmware,
- not enough testing, no soft launch

Use cloud IoT services:

- Provide security for deployments: only the right devices can
  communicate with each other
- Manage devices: manage and deploy workloads
