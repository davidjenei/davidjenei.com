IEC62443
========

The aim of the standard is to ensure that a product supplier, integrator
or an asset owner follows an efficient method for secured process with a
key aspect on safety of the personnel and the production, availability,
efficiency and quality of the production of the IACS as well as the
safety of the environment.

*IACS: Industrial automation and control system*

> [Certification example][]: The company has successfully demonstrated
> during an audit process that a Security Development Lifecycle
> Management System has been implemented and fulfils the applicable
> requirements of the standard, according Maturity Level 3: Defined -
> Practiced.

Products (devices sold and used by themselves) such as switches,
firewalls, dedicated controllers, etc. are **covered the in the “-4”
series.**

What [products] are certifiable?

62443-4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements
------------------------------------------------------------

Specifies process requirements for the secure development of products
used in industrial automation and control systems. It defines a secure
development life-cycle (SDL) for the purpose of developing and
maintaining secure products. This life-cycle includes security
requirements definition, secure design, secure implementation (including
coding guidelines), verification and validation, defect management,
patch management and product end-of-life.

**Certification scenario:** Product supplier (manufacturer) has a
development process for securely developing and supporting one or more
products as required by IEC 62443-4-1:

- A product supplier has a formal development process, such as an ISO
  9001 compliant process.
- The product developer has incorporated security into its product
  development processes according to 62443-4-1
- These security enhanced processes are formally documented.
- The product supplier submits an application for its development
  process to be assessed for conformance 62443-4-1.

62443-4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS components
--------------------------------------------------------------

Provides detailed technical control system component requirements (CRs)
associated with the seven foundational requirements (FRs) described in
IEC TS 62443-1-1 including defining the requirements for control system
capability security levels and their components, SL-C(component). As
defined in IEC TS 62443-1-1 there are a total of seven foundational
requirements (FRs): a) identification and authentication control (IAC),
b) use control (UC), c) system integrity (SI), d) data confidentiality
(DC), e) restricted data flow (RDF), f) timely response to events (TRE),
and g) resource availability (RA).

**Certification scenario:** Product supplier (manufacturer) has
developed a product and supporting services (e.g. patching) using
processes that were performed in accordance with requirements of IEC
62443-4-1. Following is the example:

- A product supplier has developed a product using 62443-4-1 processes.
- Those processes require the product supplier to apply security-related
  processes to all phases of development and support.
- The product supplier has generated documentation that shows it has
  followed it secure development processes for the product.
- This documentation shows traceability of security requirements through
  requirements definition, design and implementation, and testing.
- The product supplier submits an application to be assessed for
  conformance.

IEC 62443 requires hardware security for Security Levels 3 and 4.
