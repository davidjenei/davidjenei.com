=====================

A colleague suggested that we should create a minimal LSP implementation
to support editing a domain specific XML. The idea, is that when we edit
config XMLs in the project, a list of valid values for a certain
attribute should be listed during editing so the lucky developer can choose
from those values. This doesn't made sense to me at first, because with
XML (without being an expert in this markup language) I bet there is a
way to properly reference other elements, rather then using stringly
typed programming. (Also is there anybody who thinks that it's worth to
create project specific LSP implementations?)

There is some python training material in the works. I was wondering who
is the intended audience, but ended up deciding that I will target as
many people as possible. I will try to start every segment with laying
out the fundamentals first.

At home I managed to install the wall mount for the TV and finally put
the TV on the wall. Now we can use the TV stand properly: to store
everything else. There was a small hiccup, Anda tried to drive the screw
into the wall and managed to destroy the screwhead. We went to the
regular shop, but they served Anda with a totally different replacement:
wrong size, lenght and head. Anyway I bought one myself, and happy
ending.

We are making small steps to the wedding, I ordered the rings finally.
