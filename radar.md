My technology radar
===================

Here is where I track the technologies and techniques I work with. It is
inspired by [Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com) which is
based on the original [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)
radar. It's a way of organising tools in categories and noting the
maturity or adoption level for each.

Though I use different categories: in addition to
observing technology trends, I wanted to highlight some aspects of
embedded software engineering that I find challenging in the focus areas
section.

1.  [Languages & Libraries](#Languages%20&%20Libraries)
2.  [Platforms](#platforms)
3.  [Tools](#tools)
4.  [Techniques & Focus areas](#Techniques%20&%20focus%20areas)

Instead of including the flashy Javascript radar, I decided to keep it
simple and use a text based approach. To further simplify it, I reduced
the assessment scale to the following:

- **Adopt**: This technology is proven, mature and can be used in most
  cases
- **Evaluate**: These tools are ready to use and have been tested to
  various extent, but not as mature as the adopted ones
- **Hold**: These are the industry standard tools which I rather not use
  or only in special circumstances
