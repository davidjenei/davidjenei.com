=================

Minimal static site generator for my personal website [davidjenei.com].

Uses:

-   [lowdown] - A simple markdown translator
-   [GNU make]
-   [~20 line css]
-   no js

and my notes written in markdown.

How it works
------------

Uses `lowdown` to translate markdown documents to html. Then the
remarkable `cat` command combines that with `html` fragments to build
the pages.

Collects #tags from markdown preambles.

Helper targets will `rsync` results to my server or build customised
docs (resume).

Missing features
----------------

-   RSS: will do
-   generated pdf from resume: won't do, I'll use my favourite browser

My workflow
-----------

Coming soon.
