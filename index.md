Hi there, I'm David from [Budapest]. By day I work with (embedded)
software, while trying to reuse things and keeping it [simple].

Check my [Technology Radar] to see how I work.

About this website
------------------

This is my corner of the internet where you'll find short posts,
personal notes and links to pages I find interesting. Proud member of
the [250kB club].

Contact
-----

I do not have Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram accounts and I'm not on any
Mastodon instances. This is intentional, but it doesn't mean you
shouldn't reach out to me about anything.

The best way to keep in touch with me is via email.
