Why I have a blog
=================

Welcome to my blog.

[Schopenhauer says] when we read we effectively follow someone else's
thought process. But if we stay in read-only mode we gradually lose our
own capacity for thinking (quite the opposite concept that we have seen
in some hardware today).

This sounds a bit harsh, but I don't think this means that we all should
spend hours every day detailing out our novel ideas (if there is any).
When I think about why I should start writing, the first thing that
comes to my mind is organising knowledge. Some say that the best way to
deeply understand something is to write about it. In this blog I will
try to write about things that I find useful or interesting but mostly
about things I want to have a better understanding of.

I recently got introduced to some [indieweb principles] which inspired
me to create a place for myself on the internet. Owning and gardening
your own site is fun, and I will definitely write more about this.

As for now, I'm not starting any blog [challenge] but I try to keep
practicing writing regularly. Hopefully it will be useful for anybody
other than myself.
